        <p>Am I the only one who thinks these things are akward to start? I'm starting to regret putting this section in here. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Ok, seriously though, you already know my name and I'm assuming if you've gotten this far you know that I'm a web developer. But here's all the other stuff...</p>
        <br>
        <p>I'm in my early 30's, I have an amazing and beautiful wife who I don't deserve but have managed to rope her in with my rugged good looks and slick wit. We have four kids who are the most incredible sources of joy as well as the source of my receding hairline.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I grew up in a small town outside of Boston. Played sports and music growing up. I always loved computers, especially waiting for America Online to connect, sometimes on the 4th or 5th attempt just to get kicked off when my grandmother called the house. I was always had ideas in my head growing up, grandiose and creative things that at a young age I didn't know what to with. Music was an outlet for me but as I got older and responsibilites became greater I started to put it to the side along with anything else creative. So then fastfoward...I did some college, worked as an EMT for ten years, worked in an office, worked in retail, worked in property maitenance, worked out a bunch, and now here I am designing and creating websites. So ya, I went a little all over the grid there but I met great people along the way and even had some fun.</p>
        <br>
        <p>A couple years ago I took a coding course and have been doing it as a hobby ever since. It was fun at first but I didn't <em>LOVE</em> it. It was hard, lots of it made zero sense. But as time went on and I just kept doing it I realized that lots of the things that didn't make sense before were suddenly clear as day and thats when it turned into a passion. This is one area of my life that I get to solve problems, be creative, and build things that I can share with others. None of this is "work" to me, writing code and programming are half stress relief and half stress inducing. It is a constant piece of perfect balance in my otherwise crazy and chaotic world.</p>
        <br>
        <p>So now I freelance as a web developer, a career decision I was excited to tell my oldest daughter until her response was, "Oh...cool". I keep telling her that one day she will look back and appreciate just how cool I really am.</p>
        <br>
        <p>So that's me in a very brief and rough nutshell. A "cool", web developing, husband + father. I finally get to be creative again, I can't wait to get a new guitar and start playing again but that would only increase my cool-ness factor.</p>
        <br>
        <p>So follow along with my blog if you want to read my thoughts on coding and programming, get advice you did not ask for, and overall maybe just have a laugh or two. Cheers</p>
